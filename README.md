# go-rest-api-mongodb-using-fiber
A REST API with go lang and MongoDB - User web framework Fiber and mongo-driver to connectionwith MongoDB


This project will be included a building user management application with Golang using the Fiber framework and MongoDB. 

We will able to learn how to structure a Fiber application, build a REST API and register our data using MongoDB.

FIBER ----------------------------------------
https://github.com/gofiber/fiber

Fiber is a web framework for the Go programming language that focuses on speed, simplicity, and extensibility. It is designed to help developers build high-performance web applications with minimal boilerplate code and a simple, easy-to-use API.

Fiber is built on top of the Fasthttp server, which is a high-performance HTTP server for Go. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, and it includes features such as automatic gzip compression, request and response timeouts, and support for HTTP/2.

MONGO GO DRIVER ----------------------------------------

https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver

Mongo Go Driver is the official MongoDB driver for the Go programming language. It is developed and maintained by MongoDB, Inc. and provides a set of APIs and tools for interacting with MongoDB databases from Go applications.



Prerequisites------------------------------
Require Golang experience. Experience with MongoDB isn’t a requirement, but it’s nice to have.

We will also be needing the following:

A MongoDB account to host database. Signup is completely free.
Postman or any API testing application of your choice
